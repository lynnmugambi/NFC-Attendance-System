# NFC-Attendance-System

This is an NFC based attendance system coded in PHP for my Final year project at Asia Pacific University.
The NFC information is read by a java applet embedded on the page froma NFC reader. 

The project was implemented on a my custom framework that used a sort-of MVC architecture to pass information between the DB and front-end.
The DB used is SQLite.
